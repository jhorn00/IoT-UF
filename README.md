# IoT-UF

Lab 1 used simple sockets to communicate between an ultrasonic distance sensor and two LEDs.

Lab 2 was an android app, did not need github

Lab 3 was a restful API for a metronome service and web GUI

Lab 4 was a simple exercise in which we implemented the Atlas IoT-DDL middleware for 4+ services and entities
